Smart Contracts with Solidity
**Executive Summary:** The task assigned was to develop smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account. The completed code block succesfully meets these requiremnts and functionality to Deposit Ethe between acounts, but failed iexecuting the WIthdraw functions.

**Results: **
